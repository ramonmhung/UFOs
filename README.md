# UFOs


## Overview 

For this project we developed a webpage that displays information related to UFO sightings by searching for different locations, dates & type of evidence.

## Results 

The website works in a way that by entering certain criteria (Date, City, State & Country) you can find specific UFO sigthings throughout across the US. The output will depend on the specific information you enter. EG

## Summary 

There's certainly room for improvement on this website. The filter for state search should contain all complete states names instead of initialts in order to avoid confusion. Also when there's no information found about a certain state or date there should be a legend that specifies this information.
